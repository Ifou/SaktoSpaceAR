# 🎯 Tap-to-Place AR Model Viewer Integration

## What's Been Added

I've successfully integrated the `objPlanes.dart` tap-to-place AR functionality into your model card system! Here's what's new:

### ✅ **New Tap-to-Place AR Viewer** (`local_ar_viewer.dart`)

**Features:**

- **Tap to Place**: Simply tap on detected planes to place models
- **Local Model Loading**: Only loads models from your `assets/models/` folder
- **No Online Features**: All web/download functionality removed for offline-only experience
- **Multiple Objects**: Place multiple instances of the same model
- **Anchor-Based Placement**: Objects stay exactly where you place them
- **Professional UI**: Clean interface with live placement count

### 🔗 **Seamless Integration**

**From Model Cards to AR:**

1. **Browse Models** → Tap any model card from your gallery
2. **Enter AR View** → Camera opens with AR plane detection
3. **Tap to Place** → Tap on any detected plane to place the 3D object
4. **Place Multiple** → Keep tapping to place more instances
5. **Remove All** → Use "Remove All Objects" button when needed

### 🎮 **AR Controls**

**Tap to Place:**

- 🟦 **Blue Planes** → Detected surfaces you can tap on
- ✋ **Tap Gesture** → Places model exactly where you tap
- 📊 **Live Counter** → Shows "Objects placed: X" in real-time

**Remove All Button:**

- 🔴 **Red "Remove All Objects"** → Clears all placed models
- 🔄 **Reset Button** → Also clears everything and resets view

### 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**

**Dependencies Added:**

- `vector_math: ^2.1.4` for 3D transformations
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with proper asset paths

**Android Configuration Fixed:**

- Set `minSdk = 28` (required for AR plugin)
- Set `ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"` (plugin compatibility)

**Code Optimizations:**

- Integrated `objPlanes.dart` tap-to-place functionality
- Removed all web/online functionality from `localMain.dart`
- Fixed import conflicts (Colors from vector_math vs Flutter)
- Anchor-based object placement for precise positioning

### 📱 **How to Use**

1. **Run the App**: `flutter run`
2. **Browse Models**: See all your GLB files as cards
3. **Select Model**: Tap any card to enter AR view
4. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera access for AR
5. **Point Camera**: Aim at flat surfaces (table/floor/walls)
6. **See Blue Planes**: Wait for plane detection (blue overlay)
7. **Tap to Place**: Tap anywhere on the blue planes
8. **Place Multiple**: Keep tapping to place more objects
9. **Remove All**: Use the red button to clear everything

### 🎨 **Model Support**

**Currently Supported:**

- ✅ `arm_chair.glb`
- ✅ `blue_archive_miyako.glb`
- ✅ `home_chair.glb`
- ✅ `takodachi_rigged_hololive.glb`

**Add More Models:**

- Drop new `.glb` files into `assets/models/`
- Restart the app
- New cards appear automatically!
- Tap any card to place that model in AR

### 🔧 **Configuration Details**

**AR Settings:**

- Plane Detection: Horizontal & Vertical surfaces
- Feature Points: Visible for tracking
- World Origin: Shows coordinate system
- Tap Handling: Enabled for plane interaction
- Scale: Models placed at 20% original size
- Position: Exact tap location on detected planes

**Anchor System:**

- Each placement creates an `ARPlaneAnchor`
- Objects stay fixed in 3D space
- Multiple objects supported simultaneously
- Precise placement based on hit testing

**Error Handling:**

- Failed model loading alerts
- Plane detection guidance
- Network-free operation (100% local)
- Visual feedback for all interactions

**🚀 Your tap-to-place AR model viewer is now fully integrated and ready to use!**

Just tap any model card, then tap on detected planes to place your 3D models in augmented reality! 🌟
