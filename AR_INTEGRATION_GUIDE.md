# 🎯 Local AR Model Viewer Integration

## What's Been Added

I've successfully integrated the `localMain.dart` AR functionality into your model card system! Here's what's new:

### ✅ **New AR Viewer Screen** (`local_ar_viewer.dart`)

**Features:**

- **Local Model Loading**: Only loads models from your `assets/models/` folder
- **No Online Features**: All web/download functionality removed for offline-only experience
- **Interactive AR Controls**: Place, remove, and shuffle models in AR space
- **Professional UI**: Clean interface with instructions and model info
- **Real-time Feedback**: Snackbar notifications for user actions

### 🔗 **Seamless Integration**

**From Model Cards to AR:**

1. **Browse Models** → Tap any model card from your gallery
2. **Enter AR View** → Camera opens with AR plane detection
3. **Place Model** → Tap "Place Model" to add the 3D object
4. **Interact** → Shuffle position/rotation or remove the model

### 🎮 **AR Controls**

**Place/Remove Button:**

- 🟢 **Green "Place Model"** → Adds the selected model to AR space
- 🔴 **Red "Remove"** → Removes the current model

**Shuffle Button:**

- 🔵 **Blue "Shuffle"** → Randomly changes position, rotation, and scale

**Reset Button:**

- ⚪ **Grey "Reset"** → Clears everything and starts fresh

### 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**

**Dependencies Added:**

- `vector_math: ^2.1.4` for 3D transformations
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with proper asset paths

**Android Configuration Fixed:**

- Set `minSdk = 28` (required for AR plugin)
- Set `ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"` (plugin compatibility)

**Code Optimizations:**

- Removed all web/online functionality
- Fixed import conflicts (Colors from vector_math vs Flutter)
- Cleaned up unused dependencies from original localMain.dart

### 📱 **How to Use**

1. **Run the App**: `flutter run`
2. **Browse Models**: See all your GLB files as cards
3. **Select Model**: Tap any card to enter AR view
4. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera access for AR
5. **Point Camera**: Aim at a flat surface (table/floor)
6. **Place Model**: Tap "Place Model" when ready
7. **Interact**: Use shuffle/remove buttons to manipulate the model

### 🎨 **Model Support**

**Currently Supported:**

- ✅ `arm_chair.glb`
- ✅ `blue_archive_miyako.glb`
- ✅ `home_chair.glb`
- ✅ `takodachi_rigged_hololive.glb`

**Add More Models:**

- Drop new `.glb` files into `assets/models/`
- Restart the app
- New cards appear automatically!

### 🔧 **Configuration Details**

**AR Settings:**

- Plane Detection: Horizontal & Vertical surfaces
- Feature Points: Visible for tracking
- World Origin: Shows coordinate system
- Scale: Models placed at 20% original size
- Position: Slightly in front of camera (-0.5 Z-axis)

**Error Handling:**

- Failed model loading alerts
- Permission request guidance
- Network-free operation (100% local)
