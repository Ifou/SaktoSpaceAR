## ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic 3D Model Card System - READY TO USE!

I've created a complete dynamic card system for your GLB models! Here's what you now have:

### âœ… **What's Been Created:**

1. **`ModelCard` Widget** (`lib/widgets/model_card.dart`)

   - Automatically detects all GLB files in your assets
   - Beautiful card-based UI with gradients and icons
   - Pull-to-refresh functionality
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Smart file name conversion (snake_case â†’ "Readable Names")

2. **Complete Screens**

   - `ModelSelectionScreen` - Main model browser
   - `ARViewScreen` - Placeholder for AR implementation
   - `CustomModelBrowser` - Example of custom usage

3. **Auto-Updated pubspec.yaml**
   - Added assets folder configuration
   - Ready for dynamic GLB detection

### ðŸš€ **How It Works:**

**Add New Models â†’ Instant Visibility!**

1. Drop any `.glb` file into `assets/models/`
2. Restart the app
3. **New model cards appear automatically!**

### ðŸ“± **Current Models Detected:**

- âœ… Arm Chair (`arm_chair.glb`)
- âœ… Blue Archive Miyako (`blue_archive_miyako.glb`)
- âœ… Home Chair (`home_chair.glb`)
- âœ… Takodachi Rigged Hololive (`takodachi_rigged_hololive.glb`)

### ðŸŽ¨ **UI Features:**

- Modern card design with gradients
- AR icons and visual indicators
- File size estimates
- Tap to select models
- Error handling for missing files
- Loading states and empty states

### ðŸ”§ **Ready for AR Integration:**

The `ModelCard` widget includes a callback for model selection:

```dart
ModelCard(
  onModelSelected: (String modelPath) {
    // Connect to your AR implementation
    loadModelInAR(modelPath);
  },
)
```

### ðŸ“‹ **To Test:**

1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. You'll see all your GLB models as cards
3. Tap any card to see the selection dialog
4. Pull down to refresh the model list

### ðŸ”® **Future Additions:**

Simply add more `.glb` files to `assets/models/` and they'll appear automatically - no code changes needed!

**Your dynamic model card system is now live and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰**
